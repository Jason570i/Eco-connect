## Json-server

This project uses Json-server to simulate a RESTful API that provides data on topics related to the environment and sustainability. Json-server is a useful tool for the development and testing of web applications that need to interact with an API, as it allows for the quick and easy creation of a RESTful API using JSON files as a data source.

### Installation

To install Json-server, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Then, you can install Json-server globally using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install -g json-server

npx json-server database.json
